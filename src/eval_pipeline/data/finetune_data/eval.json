This is an intermediary phase of the movement, where the lift is transitioning.\n\n4. **Image 4**: The squat position has been reached fully here, as seen by the depth of the squat, with the barbell stabilized at shoulder height. This indicates the lowest point of the movement.\n\n5. **Image 3**: The person begins to rise from the squat. This image shows the upward movement as the squat is being completed, bringing the movement full circle back to an initial standing position.\n\nThis sequence follows the logical progression of a weightlifting movement typically found in exercises like the clean or the snatch.

This involves a partial squat to secure the barbell.\n\n5. **Stabilization (10, 12)**: The lifter stands up from the squat position, ensuring balance and stability with the barbell firmly on the shoulders.\n\n6. **Jerk Preparation (2)**: The lifter adjusts their feet and prepares for the second portion, the jerk.\n\n7. **Dip Drive (0)**: The lifter bends their knees slightly and then drives upwards to propel the barbell overhead.\n\n8. **Final Movement (14, 13)**: The barbell is extended fully overhead, and the lifter achieves lockout.\n\n9. **Stabilization Overhead (8, 9)**: The lifter holds the barbell overhead and adjusts their position for stability.\n\n10. **Return to Ground (3, 11)**: The lifter completes the lift by carefully lowering the barbell back to the starting position.\n\nThis sequence reflects the technical movements involved in Olympic weightlifting, specifically capturing the key stages from start to finish."

This represents the initial part of the lift where the person would begin to rise.\n\n2. **Image 5**:\n   - The person has begun to straighten their legs, raising their body higher from the deep squat. This indicates an upward movement as they initiate standing.\n\n3. **Image 3**:\n   - The lifter is now at a higher squat position, furthering the motion initiated in image 5. The barbell is being lifted further upwards.\n\n4. **Image 1**:\n   - Here, the person appears to be transitioning from the squat to a standing position. The legs are more extended, showing progress toward standing.\n\n5. **Image 4**:\n   - The person is now almost fully upright with the barbell in front of them. This indicates the lift is nearing completion as they continue to stand fully.\n\n6. **Image 0**:\n   - Finally, the person is fully standing, completing the lift. This represents the final phase of the movement where the lift is stable and complete.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe sequence captures the phases of a lifting movement, likely a clean, from deep squat to standing fully upright with a barbell. The progression in leg extension and bar position from each image supports the chronological order of completion as shown in the sequence [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 0]."
