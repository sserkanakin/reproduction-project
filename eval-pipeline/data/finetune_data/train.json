Here are the general steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position to Lift the Barbell**:\n   - The lifter begins with grabbing the barbell on the ground, seen in images like 0, 9, and 12.\n\n2. **First Pull**:\n   - The barbell is lifted upward from the ground to clear the knees, requiring the lifter to be in an upright posture. Look for images where the bar is off the ground (e.g., image 24).\n\n3. **Transition**:\n   - Bar reaches knee height, and lifter transitions to a semi-upright position as depicted in images such as 4 and 13.\n\n4. **Second Pull**:\n   - The lifter pulls the barbell up to the chest by rapidly extending the hips, knees, and ankles. This phase is dynamic and explosive, represented in images such as 18 and 5.\n\n5. **Catch**:\n   - The lifter catches the barbell on the shoulders and squats down, known as the \u201cclean\u201d part of the lift. Images like 1 and 22 show the barbell resting on the shoulders while the lifter is in a squat.\n\n6. **Stand Up**:\n   - The lifter stands up fully with the barbell on the shoulders, as seen in images like 6 and 8.\n\n7. **Preparation for Jerk**:\n   - Once upright, the lifter prepares for the jerk by slightly bending the knees (e.g., image 14).\n\n8. **The Jerk**:\n   - The lifter pushes the barbell overhead by driving through the legs and arms, depicted in images like 23 and 3.\n\n9. **Completion**:\n   - Finally, the lifter stabilizes the bar overhead with straight arms and the body upright, before dropping the weight. This is shown in images like 10 and 16, concluding with the bar being dropped in images like 20 and 21.\n\nBy following these fundamental steps of the clean and jerk, we can justify the provided sequence. Each image corresponds to a key phase in the lifting process, and when organized accordingly, they illustrate the chronological progression of a typical clean and jerk lift."

This is typically the starting point for a sit-up.\n\n2. **Initiating the Sit-up (Image 3):** The person begins to lean back, engaging the core. The position is slightly reclined compared to the starting position.\n\n3. **Further Recline (Image 1):** The person continues the motion, leaning further back while keeping the knees bent and arms crossed. The back is closer to the ground.\n\n4. **Lowest Point (Image 0):** The person is now fully reclined, with the upper back on the ground. This represents the endpoint of the downward motion of a sit-up.\n\n5. **Initiating the Return (Image 2):** The person begins to crunch upward. The back is starting to leave the ground, indicating the start of the upward movement.\n\n6. **Midway Up (Image 5):** The person is halfway through the sit-up, moving towards the original seated position. The torso is lifted further from the ground.\n\n7. **End Position (Image 4):** The person returns to the fully seated position, completing the sit-up cycle.\n\nThis sequence effectively shows the movement of a complete sit-up exercise, from start to finish and back, by carefully observing the shift in the person's posture from fully seated to reclined and back again."

This is the endpoint of the action before reversing the motion to return to the starting position.\n\nThe sequence progresses logically from the starting hang, through the pull-up motion, to reaching the peak."

The following explanation assumes familiarity with these movements:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: The sequence begins with image 7, where the individual is in a low squat preparing for the lift. This is a typical starting posture for a power clean, where the barbell is on the ground.\n\n2. **Initial Lift**: As the sequence progresses (images 1, 14), you see the lifter pulling the bar upwards, moving the weights from the ground to the shoulders. This is a critical transitional phase, where the lifter employs a powerful leg and back extension.\n\n3. **Front Rack Position**: Images 9, 13 show the bar being caught on the shoulders. This is called the front rack position, an intermediate point before pressing or jerking the bar overhead.\n\n4. **Recovery**: Image 20 displays the lifter standing upright with the bar securely in the front rack position, having completed the clean phase.\n\n5. **Press or Jerk Phase**: The subsequent images (0, 3, 10) capture the transition from the clean to the press or jerk. Here, the lifter uses leg drive to propel the bar upwards.\n\n6. **Full Extension**: Image 21 shows the bar beginning to move overhead. This is an indication that the individual is transitioning to the overhead press or jerk.\n\n7. **Completion**: Images 6, 16, 17, and onward depict the consolidation phase, where the bar is stabilized overhead, and the lifter prepares to lower it safely.\n\n8. **Reset and Repeat**: The later images (22 to 19) reflect a resetting of posture as the bar is lowered to the starting position, suggesting repetition of the exercise.\n\nThe sequence captures the full cycle of a power clean and press, adhering to proper movement phases. Each numbered image links sequential movements that seamlessly transition from one to the next."

The body begins to open up, and the throwing hand starts to separate from the glove.\n\n5. **Image 3**: The pitcher completes the throw with the arm following through after releasing the ball.

The pitcher's leg is starting to lift, indicating the beginning of the motion.\n\n2. **Image 6**: The pitcher is in the middle wind-up position, where the leg is raised but not at its peak. The body is more coiled, preparing for the throw.\n\n3. **Image 3**: The leg lift reaches its peak, showing full balance and preparation to move forward.\n\n4. **Image 2**: The pitcher begins the forward motion and starts transferring weight from the back to the front leg. The pitching arm is positioned to start the throw.\n\n5. **Image 5**: The arm is coming forward, and the momentum is carrying the body towards the batter. The pitcher is at the point of release.\n\n6. **Image 0**: The follow-through begins, with the pitcher transferring weight fully forward, and the back leg ideally begins to move.\n\n7. **Image 1**: The follow-through is completed, and the pitcher has returned to a balanced position after the throw, with the motion having concluded.\n\nThis sequence correctly captures the mechanics of a baseball pitch from start to finish."

It's the deepest squat position of all images.\n\n2. **Image 6**: The athlete begins rising from the squat. This image shows the initial movement upward, as the legs start to extend from the squat.\n\n3. **Image 3**: The athlete is midway through standing up. The knees are less bent than in the previous image, progressing towards full extension.\n\n4. **Image 1**: The athlete is almost fully upright. The knees are nearly straight, indicating continued upward motion.\n\n5. **Image 0**: The standing position is achieved. The athlete is fully upright with the bar still on the shoulders, completing the lift.\n\n6. **Image 2**: This shows the athlete preparing to return to the starting position. The knees begin bending again, indicating the start of the downward movement.\n\n7. **Image 5**: The athlete returns to the deep squat position. This closes the exercise cycle, ready to start another repetition.\n\nBy examining how the athlete moves from a deep squat to a standing position and back into the squat, we can place the images in logical order that follows the physical exertion sequence."

This indicates further progression of the descent, where the person is getting lower while maintaining control.\n\n4. **Image 3**: The person is in the lowest squat position in the sequence, ready to return to standing. This image would logically follow the previous pictures as it represents the continuation and conclusion of the lowering phase, ready to initiate a new lift or repetition.\n\nThese indicators align with a common weightlifting sequence, ensuring that [0, 1, 2, 3] illustrates the proper chronological order of actions during a lifting session."

This is the initial stance before any motion begins.\n\n2. **Beginning of the Windup (4)**: In image 4, the player starts the windup by taking a small step back and shifting weight. This prepares for the momentum needed in a pitch.\n\n3. **Lift of the Leg (1)**: Image 1 captures the player lifting their front leg. This movement helps generate power and balance, crucial for an effective pitch.\n\n4. **Stride (5)**: In image 5, the pitcher strides forward, lowering the lifted leg towards the ground and building forward momentum. This is in preparation to release the ball.\n\n5. **Release (3)**: Image 3 shows the pitcher in the arm-cocking position, where the arm is moving forward, about to release the ball. This is the critical release point where the ball is thrown.\n\n6. **Follow-through (2)**: After releasing the ball, image 2 portrays the follow-through, where the pitcher's body continues moving forward to dissipate energy and maintain balance.\n\n7. **Completion (0)**: Finally, in image 0, the pitch concludes with the player fully following through. The body is in a balanced position after the pitch.\n\nThe sequence makes sense based on the natural progression of pitching mechanics, from preparation to follow-through."

The arms are more extended compared to the previous image, showing continued progress in the push-up movement.\n\n4. **Completion of Movement (Image 2)**:\n   - Image 2 shows the individual in the fully extended position, which is the completion of the push-up.
