This is the starting position, indicating the beginning of the sequence.\n\n2. **Image 2**:\n   - The player has started the swing motion. The racket has moved from the initial position, and the player is preparing to make contact with the ball. This follows the initial stance.\n\n3. **Image 1**:\n   - The player is in full swing. The racket is in motion, suggesting that this is the moment right before or during contact with the ball. This follows the preparation stage.\n\n4. **Image 3**:\n   - The player is in the follow-through phase. The racket has moved past where the ball would have been. This indicates the completion of the swing and serves as the final stage in the sequence.\n\nBy observing the positions and movements of the player in each image, we establish the correct chronological order of the tennis serve."
